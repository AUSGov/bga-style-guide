<h2>Overview</h2>
<div><p>You may need approval to display a permanent, temporary or portable advertising device. An advertising device is a sign that is visible from a road or other public place, providing information or directions.</p>
<p>An advertising sign also includes any framework, supporting structure or building feature that is part of the advertisement.</p>
<p>If you are advertising on a State controlled road, please contact the State department as you may require a road corridor permit.</p></div><h2>Check if you are eligible</h2>
<div class="">
<p><p>To gain approval, your sign must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be structurally sound</li>
<li>not significantly obstruct or distract vehicular or pedestrian traffic</li>
<li>be exhibited according to applicable environmental protection policies</li>
<li>bear a reasonable relationship to the dimensions of surrounding buildings and allotments so that its presence is not overly dominating or oppressive, and it does not unreasonably obstruct existing views</li>
<li>be consistent in colour and appearance with buildings and natural features of the environment in which you plan to place it</li>
<li>be consistent with the character and values of the environment in which it is placed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also have public liability insurance for a minimum of $20 million if your sign is located on or over public land and name your council or local authority as an interested party. A copy of this document must be submitted before your application can be approved.</p></p>
