<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>You can use this compliance code as a practical guide to meet your occupational health and safety duties or obligations in relation to workplace amenities and working environments.</p>
<p>The information in this compliance code is particularly relevant if you are an employer who must provide appropriate workplace facilities. The code provides information about how to maintain adequate amenities and facilities and the broader duties of employers in relation to their use. It uses examples and tools you can apply to your own workplace.</p>
<p>As this code is based on the 2007 regulations, it does not yet reflect the changes introduced by the new regulations. Complying with this code may not necessarily mean compliance with your duties and obligations.</p></div><h2>Contact</h2>
