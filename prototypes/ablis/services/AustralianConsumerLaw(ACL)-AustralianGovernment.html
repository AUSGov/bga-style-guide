<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>If you operate a business that sells, leases or hires goods or services to consumers, you will need to comply with the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The ACL can apply regardless of the size of your business and can apply in all business structures (sole trader and others).</p>
<p>It is important that you are aware of your rights and obligations under the ACL.</p>
<p>The ACL provides a set of guarantees for consumers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the supplier has the right to sell the goods</li>
<li>the goods match their description</li>
<li>the goods are of acceptable quality</li>
<li>the goods are fit for any purpose that the consumer makes known to the supplier</li>
<li>repairs and spare parts for the goods are reasonably available</li>
<li>the services are carried out with reasonable care and skill</li>
<li>the services are completed within a reasonable time, where there is no agreed date.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ACL aims to prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>misleading and deceptive conduct</li>
<li>unconscionable conduct</li>
<li>unfair contract terms</li>
<li>unfair practices - e.g. wrongly accepting payments for goods or services not supplied.</li>
