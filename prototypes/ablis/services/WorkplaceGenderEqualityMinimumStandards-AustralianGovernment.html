<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>You must comply with the reporting requirement of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 if you operate a business where you employ, in total across your corporate structure, 100 or more employees. The standards are compliance requirements for businesses to better support gender equality and diversity within the workplace.</p>
<p>In order to meet the minimum standards a relevant employer must have a formal policy or strategy in place that specifically supports gender equality in relation to one, or more, of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender composition of the workforce</li>
<li>equal remuneration between women and men</li>
<li>availability and utility of employment terms, conditions and practices relating to flexible working arrangements for employees</li>
<li>sex-based harassment and discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum standards also require businesses to provide information relating to workplace gender equality issues to the Agency in the workplace gender equality report.</p>
<p>Despite the repeal of the Workplace Gender Equality (Minimum Standards) Instrument 2014 by this instrument, the 2014 instrument, as in force immediately before that repeal, continues to apply in relation to a reporting period that commenced before the repeal of the 2014 instrument.</p></div><h2>Contact</h2>
