<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>You will be required to comply with this code if you operate a small business. A small business is defined as any business with fewer than 15 employees. This is calculated on a simple headcount of all employees who are employed on a regular and systematic basis. <br/></p><p>This code provides protection against unfair dismissal claims, where an employer follows the code. A dismissal will be fair if the employer follows the code and can provide evidence of this.</p></div><h2>Contact</h2>
