<h2>Overview</h2>
<div><p>You will need this permit if you intend to conduct building work. A building permit certifies that the proposed building work complies with the relevant building regulations.</p>
<p>Before applying for a building permit, you need to appoint a registered building surveyor. You apply for a building permit through your building surveyor.</p>
<p>Building work is broadly defined. You should consult with the relevant Council to determine the exemptions that apply.</p>
<p>A building permit cannot be issued until a relevant planning permit (if required) is obtained.</p>
<p>A building permit will specify that either an occupancy permit or a certificate of final inspection is required on completion of the building work.</p></div><h2>Eligibility</h2>
<div class="">
<p><p>To be eligible for this permit your application must contain sufficient information to show that the building work will comply with the Building Act and Regulations.</p>
<p>This includes compliance with all Building Standards and Codes, the Five Star Energy Rating Standard, building in designated Bushfire Prone Areas, builder's registration and insurance or owner-builder certificate of consent.</p>

<li>Three copies of drawings, specifications and allotment plans in the prescribed form and copies of any computations or reports necessary to demonstrate building compliance.</li>
