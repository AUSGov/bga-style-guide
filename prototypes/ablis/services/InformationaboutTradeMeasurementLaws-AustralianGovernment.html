<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>Trade measurement laws regulate retail and wholesale transactions where you determine the price by measurement. You must comply with these laws if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>buy or sell goods or services by measurement (e.g. selling meat, buying gold or transporting freight by weight)</li>
<li>manufacture, pack, import or sell pre-packaged goods</li>
<li>supply or maintain measuring instruments used for trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers, packers, importers and retailers must ensure all batches of pre-packaged articles meet the legislative requirements for correct measurement. This includes requirements for the position, size and format of measurement labels.</p></div><h2>Contact</h2>
