<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<div><p>You will be required to comply with this Standard if you provide food service, catering and retail and handle unpackaged, potentially hazardous food that is ready to eat. The Standard aims to improve food safety and support consumer confidence.</p>
<p>Generally, this includes caterers, restaurants, caf√©s, takeaway shops, pubs, supermarkets and delis, food vans and other facilities serving food.</p>
<p>There are three food safety management tools in the Standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>tool 1: food handler training</li>
<li>tool 2: food safety supervisor (FSS)</li>
<li>tool 3: substantiation of critical food safety controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Standard classifies businesses as category one or category two businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>category one must implement all three management tools</li>
<li>category two must have a food safety supervisor and have staff trained in safe food handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, Victorian food businesses are not classified into categories but classes (classes 1, 2, 3A, 3, and 4). Please refer to the attached &amp;lsquo;Introducing Standard 3.2.2A: Food Safety Management Tools&amp;rsquo; for guidance regarding your business classification and requirements.</p></div><h2>Contact</h2>
