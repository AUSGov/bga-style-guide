                            <p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the

                                <li>class 2: premises that handle potentially hazardous foods</li>
                                <li>class 3A: premises that are home-based businesses and accommodation getaway premises
                                    that undertake specific food handling activities.</li>

                                <li>class 4: premises are predominately handling pre-packaged, low-risk foods.</li>

                            <p>A National Police Certificate is a full record of your criminal history. It displays all
                                releasable court outcomes (sentences, convictions and findings of guilt) from all
                                Australian States and Territories.</p>
                            <p>Many regulators will need you to provide a National Police Certificate as part of the
                                application process for a licence, registration or other approval. Employers or
                                volunteer organisations may also need you to provide a National Police Certificate
                                before you commence employment or volunteer work.</p>
                            <p>An application may be made by you as an individual, or on behalf of the organisation that
                                needs the information (with your consent).</p>
                            <p>Victoria Police will conduct nation-wide name checks and deliver the results to you or
                                the organisation requiring the information. Generally, information such as an
                                individual's criminal history cannot be released by Victoria Police to an organisation
                                without written consent, and strict guidelines apply to the release of criminal history
                                information to any individual or organisations.</p>
                            <p>Please read the Information Release Policy to be aware of the information released as a
                                result of the check.</p>
                            <p>Victoria Police does not conduct checks for overseas applicants or applicants for
                                residency or citizenship. These applicants must apply to the Australian Federal Police

                            <p>You will need this registration if you or your company employ workers in Victoria. You
                                will need to register for WorkCover insurance if you pay more than $7500 in wages per
                                financial year, or you employ apprentices or trainees. Your registration form must be
                                received within 60 days of the date you first meet these requirements.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of this compulsory insurance arrangement is to provide your business with
                                insurance coverage for the cost of workers compensation entitlements if any of your
                                workers are injured or become ill because of their work. Entitlements may include
                                replacement of lost income, medical and rehabilitation treatment costs, legal costs or,
                                in the event of a serious injury, lump sum compensation.</p>
                            <p>Sole-traders or partners to a partnership are not considered to be employees for
                                insurance purposes. However, directors and executive officers of a company who are paid
                                wages are considered to be employees.</p>

                            <p>You are required to pay Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) if you provide any benefit to an
                                employee or an employees' associate (e.g. a family member, etc).</p>
                            <p>Benefits include any rights, privileges or services you supply to an employee in relation
                                to their employment. For instance, you are required to pay FBT if you:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>allow an employee to use a work car for private purposes</li>
                                <li>give an employee a cheap loan</li>

                            <p>FBT is separate from income tax and is based on the taxable value of any benefits you
                                provide. You can process your FBT via your monthly or quarterly Business Activity
                                Statement (BAS).</p>
                            <p>Please note that you are required to pay FBT whether:</p>

                                <li>these benefits are provided by you, an associate of yours or a third party under an
                                    arrangement with you</li>

                            <p>Some employers, including charities, may need to work out the status of their workers.
                                Many will be volunteers, however, some will be contractors and employees. Generally,
                                benefits provided to volunteers and contractors do not attract FBT.</p>
                            <p>You can register for FBT online, by phone, though your registered tax agent or by lodging
                                your annual FTB return.</p>

                            <p>You must comply with the reporting requirement of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012
                                if you operate a business where you employ, in total across your corporate structure,
                                100 or more employees. The standards are compliance requirements for businesses to
                                better support gender equality and diversity within the workplace.</p>
                            <p>In order to meet the minimum standards a relevant employer must have a formal policy or
                                strategy in place that specifically supports gender equality in relation to one, or
                                more, of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>gender composition of the workforce</li>

                                <li>availability and utility of employment terms, conditions and practices relating to
                                    flexible working arrangements for employees</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The minimum standards also require businesses to provide information relating to
                                workplace gender equality issues to the Agency in the workplace gender equality report.
                            </p>
                            <p>Despite the repeal of the Workplace Gender Equality (Minimum Standards) Instrument 2014
                                by this instrument, the 2014 instrument, as in force immediately before that repeal,
                                continues to apply in relation to a reporting period that commenced before the repeal of
                                the 2014 instrument.</p>
