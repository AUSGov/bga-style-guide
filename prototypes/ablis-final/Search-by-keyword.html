                                and retail and handle unpackaged, potentially hazardous food that is ready to eat. The
                                Standard aims to improve food safety and support consumer confidence.</p>
                            <p>Generally, this includes caterers, restaurants, cafés, takeaway shops, pubs, supermarkets
                                and delis, food vans and other facilities serving food.</p>
                            <p>There are three food safety management tools in the Standard:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>tool 1: food handler training</li>
                                <li>tool 2: food safety supervisor (FSS)</li>
                                <li>tool 3: substantiation of critical food safety controls.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Standard classifies businesses as category one or category two businesses.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>category one must implement all three management tools</li>
                                <li>category two must have a food safety supervisor and have staff trained in safe food
                                    handling.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Please note, Victorian food businesses are not classified into categories but classes
                                (classes 1, 2, 3A, 3, and 4). Please refer to the attached &amp;lsquo;Introducing

                            <p>The Dairy Standards Code is a collection of individual food standards. Standards on
                                related matters are grouped together into Parts, which in turn are collected together
                                into three chapters:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>standards that apply to the primary production of dairy</li>
                                <li>requirements affecting the collection and transporting of dairy</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Food standards have the force of law. It is a criminal offence in Australia to supply
                                food that does not comply with relevant food standards. Notwithstanding food standards,
                                it is also an offence to sell food which is damaged, deteriorated or perished, which is
                                adulterated, or which is unfit for human consumption.</p>
