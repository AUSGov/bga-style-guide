            <h3>3. Consider other registrations your business may need</h3>
            <p>We've covered the <strong>basic business and tax registrations</strong>. There are a number of registrations you may still need before you can start trading, including licences and permits from state or territory governments. To check, use the <a href="https://ablis.business.gov.au/"  target="_blank">Australian Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS)</a>.</p>

            <h3>4. Speak to an adviser</h3>
            <p>This is only a guide! Talk to a professional if you're not sure about what business structure and registrations are right for you.</p>
