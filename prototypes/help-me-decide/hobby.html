                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Declaring payments</strong> - You do not need to declare the amounts you make from your
                        hobby to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</li>
                    <li><strong>Claiming tax deductions</strong> - You cannot claim a deduction for any losses from your
                        creative work if it is a hobby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keeping records</strong> - records You do not need to keep records of your hobby for the
                        ATO, however it’s good practice to keep records in case your circumstances change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Licences and permits</strong> - Generally, you will not need to hold licences and
                        permits for your hobby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Australian Business Number (ABN) eligibility</strong> - You are not eligible for an ABN
                        for a hobby, however if you sell goods or services to businesses, they may ask you for an ABN
                        when they pay you. You can use a Statement by a supplier form to avoid the business withholding
                        an amount from the payment to you for not having an ABN. The statement lets the business know
                        that you are selling the goods or services as your hobby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selling goods</strong> - If you’re selling goods, you’ll need to comply with Australian
                        Consumer Law (ACL). Your customers have automatic rights if they buy a product that breaks
                        easily, doesn’t work or doesn’t perform as generally expected. Read more about fair trading.
