            <p>Based on your answers a <strong>three component standard mark</strong> can be used on your food product.</p>

            <p>These standard marks are for food products that were last substantially transformed in Australia AND have Australian and imported ingredients AND were exported to an overseas country for minor processing without the further addition of non-Australian ingredients before being re-imported to Australia.</p>

            <p>The standard mark will have the kangaroo logo, bar chart and text.</p>
