</div>
<div class='result-content d-none p-4'><div class='description'>
<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You will need a development approval if you intend to propose a development that will require you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>carry out building work, plumbing or drainage work, or operational work - building a house, garage or extending an existing building, structure or making changes to the land itself (e.g. earthworks, vegetation clearing, building a pontoon)</li>
<li>reconfigure a lot - subdividing land or carrying out other actions such as amalgamating lots or rearranging boundaries</li>
<li>make a material change to use of premises - a new use of a building, structure or land, or intensifying an existing use (e.g. expanding a shopping centre, or developing a new hotel on land that was previously occupied by an office).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 categories of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>prohibited development - approval will not be given</li>
<li>assessable development - approval is required</li>
<li>accepted development - approval is not required.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assess which category your development falls into by using a categorising instrument, which includes the state legislation and local categorising instrument (such as a local government's planning scheme). A categorising instrument can specify the categories of assessment that apply to development (and other matters, such as assessment benchmarks). If no categorising instrument categorises your particular development, the development falls under the accepted development category.</p>
<p>If you are undertaking assessable development, it may be either a code assessable development or an impact assessable development. Code assessable developments do not require public consultation, while impact assessable developments do.</p>
<p>If your development involves variations from the allowed standards, you will need to have those variations assessed by the referral agency. Variations could include distance from property boundaries or the height of the building. The referral agency is likely to be the council or local authority.</p>
<p>You should contact the relevant council, local authority or agency to check if additional licences or permits are required for your development activities. For matters where the State has jurisdiction, pre-lodgement advice can be obtained by contacting the State Assessment and Referral Agency (SARA).</p></div>

</div>
<div class='result-content d-none p-4'><div class='description'>
<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.</p>
<p>You must register for GST:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover (gross income from all businesses minus GST) of $75,000 or more</li>
<li>when you start a new business and expect your turnover to reach the GST threshold (or more) in the first year of operation</li>
<li>if you're already in business and have reached the GST threshold</li>
<li>if your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
<li>when you provide taxi or limousine travel for passengers (including ride-sourcing) regardless of your GST turnover - this applies to both owner drivers and if you lease or rent a taxi</li>
<li>if you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business or enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering for GST is optional if your business or enterprise doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into one of these categories. If you choose to register, generally you must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the threshold, or are likely to exceed it. You need to register within 21 days of your GST turnover exceeding the relevant threshold.<br/>

A background music licence allows a website to use ten to fifteen sound recordings on a randomised loop. These sound recordings must not be synchronised with any content on the website.</p>

<div><p>To retail or wholesale smoking products, you must hold a smoking product supply licence. This became a requirement fromÂ <strong>1Â SeptemberÂ 2024</strong>. Without a licence you will not be able to supply smoking products. Any supply of smoking products without a licence is a breach of the <em>Tobacco and Other Smoking Products Act 1998</em>.</p>
<p>Smoking products can include tobacco products, herbal cigarettes, loose smoking blend, shisha, smoking related products or a package or carton of any of these things.</p>
<p>Federal and state changes to the regulation of vapes have commenced, which restrict the supply of therapeutic vapes to pharmacies.</p>
<p>Non-pharmacy retailers are not permitted to sell any vaping devices, vaping substances, or vaping accessories. The restriction also applies to nicotine-free vapes and includes existing stock.Â </p>
<p>There are significant penalties for businesses continuing to supply vaping goods including imprisonment, and significant financial penalties, suspension or cancellation of a smoking products licence and closure of a store.</p>
<p>There are 3 licence types available.</p>
<h3>Retail licence</h3>

<p>If you want to sell smoking products from more than 1 premises, you must submit a separate application and hold a licence for each premises.</p>
<p>A single retail licence can include 1 premises and 1 connected online retail shop.</p>
<p>If you are a retailer wanting to sell limited quantities of smoking products by wholesale to other smaller licensed retailers, you must request the sub-wholesale condition when you apply for your retail licence. This condition is only available for a retail licence if retail sales are the primary activity of your licenced business.</p>
<h3>Retail (liquor) licence</h3>
<p>A retail (liquor) licence authorises you to sell smoking products to the public from a liquor licensed premises. Only a liquor licensee may apply for a retail (liquor) licence. A copy of your liquor licence for the premises is required as part of the application process.</p>
<p>If you want to sell smoking products from more than 1 liquor licensed premises, you must apply and obtain a licence for each premises.</p>
<p>A retail (liquor) licence limits the supply of smoking products from the liquor licensed premises. Online supply of smoking products is not permitted.</p>
<h3>Wholesale licence</h3>
<p>A wholesale licence authorises you to sell smoking products by wholesale to licensed retailers from a wholesale premises or an online wholesale outlet.</p>
<p>If you want to sell smoking products from more than 1 wholesale premises, you must submit a separate application and hold a licence for each premises. Where your wholesale premises has an online outlet for online sales connected to the wholesale premises, a single wholesale licence authorises you to sell smoking products from both.</p>
