<h3 class='title m-0 p-0'>Development approval - Brisbane City Council - Queensland</h3>
</div>
<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You will need a development approval if you intend to propose a development that will require you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>carry out building work, plumbing or drainage work, or operational work - building a house, garage or extending an existing building, structure or making changes to the land itself (e.g. earthworks, vegetation clearing, building a pontoon)</li>
<li>reconfigure a lot - subdividing land or carrying out other actions such as amalgamating lots or rearranging boundaries</li>
<li>make a material change to use of premises - a new use of a building, structure or land, or intensifying an existing use (e.g. expanding a shopping centre, or developing a new hotel on land that was previously occupied by an office).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 categories of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>prohibited development - approval will not be given</li>
<li>assessable development - approval is required</li>
<li>accepted development - approval is not required.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assess which category your development falls into by using a categorising instrument, which includes the state legislation and local categorising instrument (such as a local government's planning scheme). A categorising instrument can specify the categories of assessment that apply to development (and other matters, such as assessment benchmarks). If no categorising instrument categorises your particular development, the development falls under the accepted development category.</p>
<p>If you are undertaking assessable development, it may be either a code assessable development or an impact assessable development. Code assessable developments do not require public consultation, while impact assessable developments do.</p>
<p>If your development involves variations from the allowed standards, you will need to have those variations assessed by the referral agency. Variations could include distance from property boundaries or the height of the building. The referral agency is likely to be the council or local authority.</p>
<p>You should contact the relevant council, local authority or agency to check if additional licences or permits are required for your development activities. For matters where the State has jurisdiction, pre-lodgement advice can be obtained by contacting the State Assessment and Referral Agency (SARA).</p></div>

</div>
<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.</p>
<p>You must register for GST:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover (gross income from all businesses minus GST) of $75,000 or more</li>
<li>when you start a new business and expect your turnover to reach the GST threshold (or more) in the first year of operation</li>
<li>if you're already in business and have reached the GST threshold</li>
<li>if your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
<li>when you provide taxi or limousine travel for passengers (including ride-sourcing) regardless of your GST turnover - this applies to both owner drivers and if you lease or rent a taxi</li>
<li>if you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business or enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering for GST is optional if your business or enterprise doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into one of these categories. If you choose to register, generally you must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the threshold, or are likely to exceed it. You need to register within 21 days of your GST turnover exceeding the relevant threshold.<br/>

</div>
<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You will require this licence if you intend to broadcast protected sound recordings or music videos online (called webcasting). There are three types of webcasting licences:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-interactive streaming licence</li>
<li>semi-interactive streaming licence</li>
<li>background music on websites licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>A non-interactive streaming licence covers webcasters who offer audio streaming services that don't have any interactive features such as a 'stop', 'play' or 'skip' button. A semi-interactive streaming licence allows a limited number of interactive features, such as the ability to 'pause' or 'skip' a sound recording, but does not allow the ability to choose specific songs. A background music licence allows a website to use ten to fifteen sound recordings on a randomised loop. These sound recordings must not be synchronised with any content on the website.</p>
<p>This licence covers the sound recording only. Please note that depending on the nature of your activities you may also be required to hold a licence with APRA. It is recommended that you discuss your licensing needs with both Agencies prior to applying.</p></div>
