<h3 class='title m-0 p-0'>Goods and Services Tax (GST) Registration - Australian Government</h3>
</div>
<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'>
<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.</p>
<p>You must register for GST:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover (gross income from all businesses minus GST) of $75,000 or more</li>
<li>when you start a new business and expect your turnover to reach the GST threshold (or more) in the first year of operation</li>
<li>if you're already in business and have reached the GST threshold</li>
<li>if your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
<li>when you provide taxi or limousine travel for passengers (including ride-sourcing) regardless of your GST turnover - this applies to both owner drivers and if you lease or rent a taxi</li>
<li>if you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business or enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering for GST is optional if your business or enterprise doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into one of these categories. If you choose to register, generally you must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the threshold, or are likely to exceed it. You need to register within 21 days of your GST turnover exceeding the relevant threshold.<br/>

<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'>
<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You will need this registration if you or your company employ workers in Victoria. You will need to register for WorkCover insurance if you pay more than $7500 in wages per financial year, or you employ apprentices or trainees. Your registration form must be received within 60 days of the date you first meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this compulsory insurance arrangement is to provide your business with insurance coverage for the cost of workers compensation entitlements if any of your workers are injured or become ill because of their work. Entitlements may include replacement of lost income, medical and rehabilitation treatment costs, legal costs or, in the event of a serious injury, lump sum compensation.</p>
<p>Sole-traders or partners to a partnership are not considered to be employees for insurance purposes. However, directors and executive officers of a company who are paid wages are considered to be employees.</p></div>

<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You are required to pay Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) if you provide any benefit to an employee or an employees' associate (e.g. a family member, etc).</p>
<p>Benefits include any rights, privileges or services you supply to an employee in relation to their employment. For instance, you are required to pay FBT if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow an employee to use a work car for private purposes</li>
<li>give an employee a cheap loan</li>
<li>reimburse an expense incurred by your employee (e.g. school fees)</li>
<li>provide entertainment by way of food, drink or recreation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FBT is separate from income tax and is based on the taxable value of any benefits you provide. You can process your FBT via your monthly or quarterly Business Activity Statement (BAS).</p>
<p>Please note that you are required to pay FBT whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>these benefits are provided by you, an associate of yours or a third party under an arrangement with you</li>
<li>an employee is a current, future or former employee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some employers, including charities, may need to work out the status of their workers. Many will be volunteers, however, some will be contractors and employees. Generally, benefits provided to volunteers and contractors do not attract FBT.</p>
<p>You can register for FBT online, by phone, though your registered tax agent or by lodging your annual FTB return.</p></div>
