</div>
<div class='result-content p-4'><div class='description'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.</p>
<p>You must register for GST:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover (gross income from all businesses minus GST) of $75,000 or more</li>
<li>when you start a new business and expect your turnover to reach the GST threshold (or more) in the first year of operation</li>
<li>if you're already in business and have reached the GST threshold</li>
<li>if your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
<li>when you provide taxi or limousine travel for passengers (including ride-sourcing) regardless of your GST turnover - this applies to both owner drivers and if you lease or rent a taxi</li>
<li>if you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business or enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering for GST is optional if your business or enterprise doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into one of these categories. If you choose to register, generally you must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the threshold, or are likely to exceed it. You need to register within 21 days of your GST turnover exceeding the relevant threshold.<br/>

<p>An incorporated association and its members are legally separate. Under normal circumstances, it provides protection to the management committee from personal liability for the actions of the incorporated association, provided they are carried out in good faith and due diligence.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>allow an employee to use a work car for private purposes</li>
<li>give an employee a cheap loan</li>
<li>reimburse an expense incurred by your employee (e.g. school fees)</li>
<li>provide entertainment by way of food, drink or recreation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FBT is separate from income tax and is based on the taxable value of any benefits you provide. You can process your FBT via your monthly or quarterly Business Activity Statement (BAS).</p>
<p>Please note that you are required to pay FBT whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>these benefits are provided by you, an associate of yours or a third party under an arrangement with you</li>
<li>an employee is a current, future or former employee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some employers, including charities, may need to work out the status of their workers. Many will be volunteers, however, some will be contractors and employees. Generally, benefits provided to volunteers and contractors do not attract FBT.</p>
