</div>
<div class='result-content d-none p-4'><div class='description'>
<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia.</p>
<p>You must register for GST:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover (gross income from all businesses minus GST) of $75,000 or more</li>
<li>when you start a new business and expect your turnover to reach the GST threshold (or more) in the first year of operation</li>
<li>if you're already in business and have reached the GST threshold</li>
<li>if your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
<li>when you provide taxi or limousine travel for passengers (including ride-sourcing) regardless of your GST turnover - this applies to both owner drivers and if you lease or rent a taxi</li>
<li>if you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business or enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering for GST is optional if your business or enterprise doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into one of these categories. If you choose to register, generally you must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>If you're not registered for GST, check each month to see if you've reached the threshold, or are likely to exceed it. You need to register within 21 days of your GST turnover exceeding the relevant threshold.<br/>

<div><p>Incorporation allows associations to establish a corporate identity and provides legal status in return for accepting certain legal responsibilities. An incorporated association has the benefits of limited liability, can enter into contracts, and can sue and be sued.</p>

<p>An incorporated association and its members are legally separate. Under normal circumstances, it provides protection to the management committee from personal liability for the actions of the incorporated association, provided they are carried out in good faith and due diligence.</p></div>

<div class='description-content'><div class="serviceSection" id="serviceDetailDescription">

<div><p>You are required to pay Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) if you provide any benefit to an employee or an employees' associate (e.g. a family member, etc).</p>
<p>Benefits include any rights, privileges or services you supply to an employee in relation to their employment. For instance, you are required to pay FBT if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow an employee to use a work car for private purposes</li>
<li>give an employee a cheap loan</li>
<li>reimburse an expense incurred by your employee (e.g. school fees)</li>
<li>provide entertainment by way of food, drink or recreation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FBT is separate from income tax and is based on the taxable value of any benefits you provide. You can process your FBT via your monthly or quarterly Business Activity Statement (BAS).</p>
<p>Please note that you are required to pay FBT whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>these benefits are provided by you, an associate of yours or a third party under an arrangement with you</li>
<li>an employee is a current, future or former employee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some employers, including charities, may need to work out the status of their workers. Many will be volunteers, however, some will be contractors and employees. Generally, benefits provided to volunteers and contractors do not attract FBT.</p>
<p>You can register for FBT online, by phone, though your registered tax agent or by lodging your annual FTB return.</p></div>

<div><p>You must comply with the reporting requirement of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 if you operate a business where you employ, in total across your corporate structure, 100 or more employees. The standards are compliance requirements for businesses to better support gender equality and diversity within the workplace.</p>
<p>In order to meet the minimum standards a relevant employer must have a formal policy or strategy in place that specifically supports gender equality in relation to one, or more, of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender composition of the workforce</li>
<li>equal remuneration between women and men</li>
<li>availability and utility of employment terms, conditions and practices relating to flexible working arrangements for employees</li>
<li>sex-based harassment and discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum standards also require businesses to provide information relating to workplace gender equality issues to the Agency in the workplace gender equality report.</p>
<p>Despite the repeal of the Workplace Gender Equality (Minimum Standards) Instrument 2014 by this instrument, the 2014 instrument, as in force immediately before that repeal, continues to apply in relation to a reporting period that commenced before the repeal of the 2014 instrument.</p></div>
