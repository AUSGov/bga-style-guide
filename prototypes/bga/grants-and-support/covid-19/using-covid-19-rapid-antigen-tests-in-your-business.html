                    <h2>Check your state or territory requirements</h2>

                    <p>States and territories may have different recommendations for testing and reporting positive
                        results based on their public health orders.<br /><br />Stay up-to-date on the latest
                        information on rapid antigen testing in your state or territory:</p>

                    <h2>Choose the type of rapid antigen test that's best for your business</h2>

                    <p>The two key types of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Point-of-care (PoC) tests - approximately $7-15 each, but must be performed under the
                            supervision of a health practitioner, which may have more costs.</li>
                        <li>Self-tests - ranging from $12-20 each, self-tests can be used unsupervised at home without
                            the involvement of a health practitioner. The person performing the test interprets the
                            results by themselves.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3>Be aware of rapid antigen test scams</h3>
                        <div>
                        <p>It's important to be aware of scams to protect yourself when purchasing rapid antigen tests. Here are some tips to help keep you safe from testing scams:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Purchase rapid antigen tests from a trusted and legitimate business that can validate the standard of the tests.</li>
                        <li>When purchasing from an online store, look for a URL that starts with “https” and a closed padlock symbol to show that information transmitted on that site is secure.</li>
                        <li>Avoid paying up-front, via money order, wire transfer, international funds transfer, pre-loaded card, or electronic currency like Bitcoin.</li>
                        <li>Carefully check the messaging from your regular suppliers, as scammers may pretend to be a business you usually deal with. Verify any requests to change any payment arrangements by calling them on a known and trusted number.</li>
                        <li>Get quotes from more than one supplier to help you work out the best price.</li>
                        <li>Keep records of rapid antigen test delivery, specifications and user instructions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Know how you will verify, document, report and store the testing results</h2>

                        <p>The Australian privacy legislation has specific clauses relating to medical and health information. If you're considering PoC testing, it is important you know your legal requirements relating to data collection and relevant use of private health data.</p>
