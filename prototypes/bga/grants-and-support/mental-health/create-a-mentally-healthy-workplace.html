                                <div>
                                    <p>As a business owner, you have a duty under work health and safety (WHS) laws to
                                        manage risks to your workers’ mental health arising from their work. You’re
                                        legally required to look after your workers' mental health under a variety of
                                        laws. This includes:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Providing a physically and mentally safe workplace and managing any risks to
                                            the mental health of your workers arising from the work of your business
                                            (WHS laws).</li>
                                        <li>Preventing discrimination against workers with a mental health condition
                                            (anti-discrimination laws).</li>
                                        <li>Protecting your workers’ personal information – don't tell anyone about your
                                            workers’ mental health conditions unless they agree to it (privacy laws).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Not taking any unfair action against someone because of their mental health
                                            condition (fair work laws).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <h2>Manage mental health risks</h2>
<div>
<p>Risks to mental health can be managed through the same process as you use for physical risks:</p>
<ul>
<li> identify the hazards</li>
<li> assess the risks</li>
<li> control the risks</li>
<li> continually review the control measures to make sure they are working.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with physical risks, you should involve and consult your workers throughout this process. Your workers are a great source of information on the risks in their work and options to manage these.</p>
<p>To identify the hazards:</p>
<ul>
<li> have regular conversations with your workers to find out how they are</li>
<li> understand causes of stress in the workplace and manage them</li>
<li> look out for signs of stress in your workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stress is the physical, mental and emotional reactions you have when the demands of your job exceed your ability or resources to cope. Stress itself is not an injury but if prolonged or severe can cause psychological and physical injury.</p>
<h2>Promote good mental health in your business</h2>
<div>
<p>There are simple steps you can take to build and promote a mentally healthy workplace:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect your employees from bullying, harassment or discrimination.</li>
<li>Ensure your staff have the right level of training and support.</li>
<li>Talk to your employees about mental health in the workplace - be open about mental health and check in to see how they are going.</li>
<li>Provide a healthy work/life balance.</li>
<li>Make sure your employees know where to go for help.</li>
<li>Look after yourself - running a business can be tough, but there is help available.</li>
</ol>
