                <p>FBT is a tax that employers pay on benefits paid to an employee (or their associate, such as a family member) in addition to their salary or wages. FBT is calculated on the taxable value of the benefits you provide. This is separate to income tax.</p>

                        <p>Generally, you won't pay FBT if you host a Christmas party for your current employees on your business premises on a work day and provide food and drink only, or keep the cost of the party below $300 per employee and certain conditions are met.</p>"
