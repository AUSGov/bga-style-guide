                <h2>Choose a company name</h2>

                <p>When you register a company you can choose a name for the company, although it is not compulsory. You can use either:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a name you've chosen for your new company</li>
                <li>a name that you've already reserved with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC), or</li>
                <li>your Australian Company Number (ACN) once it has been issued.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you decide to use a company name, it must show the legal status of the company. For example 'My Business Pty Ltd'.</p>
                <p>You can only choose a company name not already registered to another company or as a business name.</p>
