                <p>You should cancel your ABN if your business:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>has been sold</li>
                <li>has closed down</li>
                <li>has changed business structures</li>
                <li>is no longer operating in Australia or making supplies connected with Australia</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Before you cancel your ABN</h2>
                
                <p>Before you can cancel, you’ll need to meet the lodgment, reporting and payment obligations for all the government agencies you deal with. It is recommended you wait to cancel your ABN until all processes are completed.</p>
                <p>Your business might need to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>lodge activity statements</li>
                <li>lodge pay as you go (PAYG) withholding reports</li>
                <li>repay goods and services tax (GST) credit refunds</li>
                <li>pay outstanding tax debts</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Other registrations will be cancelled</h3>
                <p>Be aware that cancelling your ABN will also cancel your registration for:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>any representative holding a login credential for your business. This may prevent you from using some government online services</li>
                <li>GST, luxury car tax (LCT), wine equalisation tax (WET) and fuel tax credits (FTC)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>If you can’t cancel your ABN online</h3>
                <p>There are other options available to cancel your ABN.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Call the Australian Business Register on 13 92 26 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday. You must be recorded as authorised to update ABN details for your business. You’ll also need to prove your identity. It’s a good idea to have your tax file number (TFN) handy to do this.</li>
                <li>Lodge an Application to Cancel Registration form. Order this form online by searching for NAT number 2955.</li>
                <li>Ask your registered tax agent or BAS agent to cancel your ABN.</li>
