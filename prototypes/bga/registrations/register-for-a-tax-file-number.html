            <h2>Why you need a tax file number (TFN)</h2>

            <p>A tax file number (TFN) is a unique number issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to individuals and organisations.</p>
            <p>Registering for a TFN is an important step when starting your business. You can then give it to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>investment bodies responsible for paying interest, dividends and unit trust distributions</li>
            <li>government bodies, for example the ATO, when applying for an Australian business number (ABN) or lodging income tax returns</li>
            <li>employers (this applies to individuals only)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Check which type of TFN your business needs</h2>

            <p>This depends on your business structure.</p>
            <h3>If you operate a partnership, company or trust</h3>
            <p>You’ll need a separate TFN for your business. Most businesses can apply for a TFN when they apply for an ABN.</p>
            <h3>If you're a sole trader</h3>
            <p>Use your individual TFN when you deal with the ATO. If you don’t have one, you can apply for an individual TFN on the ATO website.</p>
