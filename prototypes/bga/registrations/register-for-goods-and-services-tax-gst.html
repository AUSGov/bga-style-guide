                <p>Goods and services tax (GST) is a tax of 10% on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia. If your business is registered for GST, you have to collect this extra money (one-eleventh of the sale price) from your customers. You pay this to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) when it’s due.</p>

                <h2>Check if your business needs to register for GST</h2>
                
                <p>You must register for GST if:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>your business has a GST turnover of $75,000 or more</li>
                <li>your non-profit organisation has a GST turnover of $150,000 or more</li>
                <li>you provide taxi or limousine travel (including ride-sourcing services like Uber, GoCatch, Didi or OLA) regardless of your GST turnover</li>
                <li>you want to claim fuel tax credits for your business, regardless of your GST turnover</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you’re a non-resident there are special rules that may apply to you.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, registration for GST is optional.</p>
