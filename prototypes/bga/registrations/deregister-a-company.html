                <h2>Voluntarily deregister your company</h2>

                <p>A company officially closes when it is deregistered with the <a href="">Australian Securities &amp;
                        Investments Commission (ASIC)</a>.</p>
                <p>When you deregister a company, it will cease to exist as a legal entity and is no longer able to
                    trade.</p>
                <p>Until you deregister the company, it must continue to meet all the legal requirements of a company.
                    This includes annual review fee payments, even if it is no longer trading.</p>
                <p>Consult your legal adviser, accountant or <a href="">business adviser</a> for advice to make sure
                    closing your business is the right move.</p>

                <h2>Eligibility to voluntarily deregister</h2>

                <p>Only solvent companies can voluntarily deregister. If your company is insolvent, read ASIC’s guidance
                    on how you can <a href="">wind up an insolvent company</a>. In order to voluntarily deregister your
                    company, it must meet all of the following conditions:</p>
