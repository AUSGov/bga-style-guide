                <h2>Why do you need to register your business?</h2>
                <p>To comply with the law, your business may need specific registrations, licences or permits. The types
                    you need will depend on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>your business structure (for example sole trader, company, partnership)</li>
                    <li>your business location</li>
                    <li>the industry and sector you operate in</li>
                    <li>whether your business employs staff</li>
                    <li>the type of business you're operating.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your business doesn't have the right registrations it can affect your tax rate or result in penalties or fines.</p>
