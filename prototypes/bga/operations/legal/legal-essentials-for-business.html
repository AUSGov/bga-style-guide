                <p>When you start a business, you need to understand what laws apply to your new business. Consult a
                    legal expert or <a>business adviser</a> to understand which laws you will need to follow.</p>
                <h2>Business registrations</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><a>Business name</a> – if you want to trade under a particular name, you may need to register
                        it.</li>
                    <li><a>Trade marks</a> - if you want exclusive rights to a business name, you need to register a

                    <li><a>Website domains</a> - if you set up a website, you need to register a domain name.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fair trading</h2>
                <p>Fair trading laws ensure your business operates fairly and competitively. These laws also ensure that
                    you inform and protect your customers.</p>
                <p>To make sure your business meets fair trading regulations, you need to consider:</p>

                </ul>
                <h2>Contracts</h2>
                <p>When you agree to do a job in exchange for money or some other benefit, you're probably entering a
                    commercial contract. This contract is legally enforceable regardless of whether it is a ‘handshake
                    deal’ or written agreement.</p>
                <p>Make sure you understand the <a>contract</a> before signing.</p>
                <h2>Privacy laws</h2>
                <p>If you collect and store your customers’ personal information, you must comply with <a>privacy
                        laws</a>. These laws detail how a business must handle personal information, especially as it
                    relates to direct marketing purposes.</p>
                <p>Use the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner <a>checklist</a> to help you determine
                    whether you need to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

                <h2>Employment laws</h2>

                    <p>You have legal obligations when you employ people. Your obligations require you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a>pay your employees</a> correct wages</li>
                        <li>abide by <a>work health and safety</a> (WHS) regulations and codes of practice</li>
                        <li>ensure you have <a>workers’ compensation insurance</a> for each employee</li>
                        <li>not act in a way that may seriously damage an employee's reputation or cause <a>mental
                                distress</a> or humiliation</li>
                        <li>comply with any working with vulnerable people or children requirements.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>Anti-bullying laws</h2>

                    <p>Bullying at work occurs when a person or group of people, repeatedly behave unreasonably towards
                        a worker and put the worker's health or safety at risk.</p>
                    <p>Harassment and bullying in the workplace has legal risks. If you employ people, be aware of the
                        steps you can take to minimise your potential liability.</p>

                    <h2>Unfair dismissal</h2>

                    <p>The Small Business Fair Dismissal Code provides small businesses with a process to follow if they
                        need to dismiss an employee. The Code applies to your business if you have less than 15
                        employees.</p>

                    <h2>Contractors</h2>

                    <p>You need to comply with different legal obligations when hiring a contractor or an employee. Make
                        sure you understand the difference between a contractor and an employee.</p>


                    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>

                    <p>Your business may have intellectual property (IP) it needs to protect. Before applying for your
                        intellectual property right, you should do a comprehensive search to make sure that it isn’t
                        already registered.</p>
                    <p>You can register IP yourself or seek advice from legal professionals.</p>

                    <h2>Importing and exporting</h2>

                    <p>You must follow certain laws and permits before you import or export products. Understand your
                        legal requirements of importing or exporting as part of your business operations.</p>

                    <h2>Environmental protections</h2>

                    <p>Federal, state and local governments jointly administer the environmental protection laws in
                        Australia. As a business owner, you need to understand which laws apply to you.</p>

                    <h2>Marketing compliance</h2>

                    <p>You must comply with relevant regulations when marketing your products or services. These
                        regulations ensure that you don’t mislead your customers.</p>
                    <p>These regulations include laws on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> advertising</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>

                    <p>If your business operates digitally, you may need to include your policies on your website. The
                        most common policies on websites include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Terms and conditions</li>
                        <li>Privacy policy</li>
                        <li>Returns policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Terms and conditions help establish how visitors, users and customers use your
                        website.<br /><br />As your customers may not interact with you directly before purchasing a
                        product or service, terms and conditions may act as a contract between you and the customer.</p>
