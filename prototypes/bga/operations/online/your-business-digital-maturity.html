                <p>s your business ready to thrive, succeed and go digital? We have developed the first version of the
                    Digital Readiness Assessment Tool to help you better understand how digitally prepared your business
                    is.</p>

                <h2>What is the Digital Readiness Assessment Tool?</h2>

                <p>The Digital Readiness Assessment Tool was developed to help identify what your business is doing well
                    and where your business can improve when it comes to digital maturity.</p>
                <p>You can measure your digital maturity and readiness against the 7 key pillars of digital
                    transformation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Customer</strong> – how you interact with your customers and the digital channels you
                        use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operations</strong> – what systems and administrative technology you use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data and analytics</strong> – how you collect and use data for decision making.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology</strong> – what hardware, software, devices and platforms you use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk, privacy and cybersecurity</strong> – how you keep data safe and what policies and
                        procedures you have in place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital capability and culture</strong> – what digital skills you and your team have.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Digital strategy and innovation</strong> – your planning, investment and involvement in
                        technology.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How to use the Digital Readiness Assessment Tool</h2>

                    data, and how they inform business decisions.</p>

                    against other Australian businesses and a list of recommendations to action.</p>
