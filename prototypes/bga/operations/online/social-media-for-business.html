                <h2>About social media</h2>

                <p>Social media is online communication that allows you to interact with your customers and share

                    <li>create online networks</li>
                    <li>sell and promote your products and services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, there is risk in using social media for your business. Tread carefully and learn both the
                    pros and cons before you start.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of social media for business</h2>

                <p>Social media can help you engage with your customers and find out what people are saying about your
                    business. You can also use social media for advertising, promotional giveaways and mobile
                    applications.</p>
                <p>Social media can help your business to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>attract customers, get customer feedback and build customer loyalty</li>
                    <li>increase your market reach, including international markets</li>
                    <li>do market research and reduce marketing costs</li>
                    <li>increase revenue by building customer networks and advertising</li>
                    <li>develop your brand</li>
                    <li>exchange ideas to improve the way you do business</li>

                    <li>keep an eye on your competitors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Disadvantages of social media</h2>

                <p>Social media may not suit every business. If you launch your social media presence without planning,
                    you could end up wasting valuable time and money.</p>
                <p>Disadvantages of social media include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>needing additional resources to manage your online presence</li>
                    <li>social media is immediate and needs active daily monitoring</li>
                    <li>you may get unwanted or inappropriate behaviour on your social media site</li>
                    <li>the risk of getting negative feedback, information leaks or hacking</li>
                    <li>the risk of having false or misleading claims made on your social media (by your business or a
                        customer). These claims can be subject to consumer law. For example, if a customer or fan posts
                        misleading or deceptive information, particularly about competitor products or services, you
                        might receive a fine.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To avoid the risks, have a social media strategy with policies and procedures in place before you
                    start.</p>


                <h2>Types of social media</h2>

                <p>Not all social media platforms will be right for your business. Save time and effort by choosing
                    social media platforms that your target audience will use. Below is a brief guide to help you
                    understand some of the options available.</p>

                <h2>Create your social media strategy</h2>

                <p>Doing the ground work before you start is critical to a successful social media presence. Develop
                    your social media strategy to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>create compelling content</li>
                    <li>engage with your customers at the right time</li>
                    <li>generate sales.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A social media strategy describes how your business will use social media to achieve its
                    communications aims. It also outlines the social platforms and tools you’ll use to achieve this.</p>
                <p>Follow your strategy and don't overwhelm your customers with unnecessary posts. Remain focused on
                    reaching your specific goals and tailor your messages around these.</p>
