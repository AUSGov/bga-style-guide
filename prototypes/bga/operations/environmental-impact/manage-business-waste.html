                        <div>
                            <p>Waste management is not just about how you handle waste material. It’s also about using
                                resources more efficiently to avoid or reduce waste.</p>
                            <p>Think about a key product or service for your business. For each stage in its lifecycle,
                                consider whether you could be using resources more efficiently. For example, how are
                                your products manufactured, packaged, transported, used, recycled and disposed of.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>To improve waste management, you’ll need to assess the waste you’re currently producing.
                                A quick look in your bins will help you to understand the types of waste and how much
                                waste your business produces. Bin Trim is a tool that can help you measure the amount of
                                waste your business creates and identify materials you could recycle or reuse.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Once you’ve got an understanding of your business waste, the ‘3 Rs’ can help you to
                                manage your waste better. Here are some tips to help your business
                                to <strong>reduce</strong>, <strong>reuse</strong> and <strong>recycle</strong> waste
                                materials.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Introduce a waste reduction program</strong> – involve your staff by
                                    appointing a waste management coordinator to establish a waste reduction program and
                                    identify local recyclers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Separate the different types of waste</strong> – it’s important to know what
                                    rubbish your business can recycle or reuse. Have separate bins for different types
                                    of waste.</li>
                                <li><strong>Review your products </strong>– consider the cost of disposing of materials
                                    compared to the cost of producing or buying them. Could your business use less
                                    packaging material, or better still, reuse or recycle?</li>
                                <li><strong>Buy green </strong>– talk to your suppliers about using environmentally
                                    friendly products, materials or services.</li>
                            </ul>

                        listed some common examples below, but make sure to check the waste management rules in your
                        state or territory for your obligations.</p>

                            materials. The usual disposal method is to incinerate. Another option is to place the waste
                            in a prescribed container for collection and disposal by a licensed waste transporter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electronic waste </strong>–there are free recycling services for e-waste across
                            Australia. Find a recycling drop-off point near you.</li>

                <h2>5. Check waste management rules in your state or territory</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Waste management rules and assistance vary between states and territories. Check with your state,
                        territory and local government for obligations and local services.</p>
