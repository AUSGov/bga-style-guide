                <p>Conserving water is not only good for the environment, but also for your business’s bottom line.</p>
                <p>By simply managing the runoff of water on a building site, or recycling the water you use, your business can significantly reduce its water bills. You may even gain a marketing advantage over your competitors.</p>

                <h2>1. Monitor your water usage and create a benchmark</h2>
                <div>
                <p>Monitoring your water use helps you understand your water usage patterns, identify leaks and improve inefficiencies.</p>
                <p>Establish your water usage benchmark to develop an understanding of what your regular usage is and what you should expect from future water usage.</p>
                <p>To create your benchmark, begin by regularly recording your water usage. You can note the details in a log book or an online software that measures your water usage and waste.</p>
                <p>The best way to monitor your water usage is to install sub meters on your premises. The sub meters can help you identify when and how your water is being used.</p>

                <h2>2. Identify any leaks</h2>
                <div>It’s important to pinpoint any water leaks you have. Water leaks are a form of water wastage and can increase your water bill.<br /><br />If there is no known water consumption during a particular period, yet you are still consuming water, you may have a leak. If this happens, an inspection of your pipes should resolve any problems.</div>

                <h2>3. Use water effectively</h2>
                <div>
                <p>There are many ways to reduce your water use and use water more efficiently. By finding alternate ways to reuse or recycle waste water, you can reduce your business's water usage, expenses and environmental impact.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Consider installing flow restrictors or water saving devices where possible to minimise unnecessary water consumption.</li>
                <li>Install rainwater tanks and other water savings tactics to increase savings on your water bills, help combat water shortages and provide access to fresh water during times of water restrictions and droughts.</li>
                <li>Take note of the<a href=""> Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (WELS) </a>labels on equipment that you purchase. By choosing a product with a higher rating, you are making a more environmentally friendly choice and may save money on water over time.</li>

                <h2>4. Check state and territory water rules</h2>
