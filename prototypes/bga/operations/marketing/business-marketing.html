                <h2>Marketing explained</h2>
                <div>
                <p>There are many definitions of marketing. Broadly, it involves activities that help to build your brand and business. It’s about identifying and understanding your customers, and developing products and services that meet their needs. Marketing requires careful planning and research – but investing time and money now will pay off in the long term.</p>
                <p>Marketing is more than just advertising and logos, it can be across many areas of your business, including:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>how your customers are greeted on the phone</li>
                <li>your customer service procedures</li>
                <li>what your staff wear</li>
                <li>your email signature.</li>
                </ul>
