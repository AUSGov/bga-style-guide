                    <p>There are both primary and secondary methods of research you can use to conduct your market research.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Primary research involves gathering information yourself first-hand.</li>
                    <li>Secondary research uses information and data that has already been collected and analysed by others.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Before you embark on gathering first-hand information about your market, you can use research that has already been done. For example, look for market reports, government statistics, and trade and industry association publications.</p>
                    <h3>Sources of government statistics and data</h3>
