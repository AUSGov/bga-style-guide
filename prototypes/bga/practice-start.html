            <h2>This is a practice task to help you get familiar with our Loop11 research software.</h2>

            <h3>Step 1:</h3> 
            <p>You will be shown this activity window which will contain a task for you to complete. After you have read the task, press the ‘Start activity’ button to begin. This will cause the activity window to minimise and be positioned in the bottom left corner of your screen (purple circle). Press the ‘Start task’ button now to demonstrate this.</p>

            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            <p>Make sure you refer back to the activity window to check you have completed all parts of the task. To bring up the activity window at any point, click on the purple circle on the bottom left of your screen. Try doing this now.</p>

            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            <p> The activity window can be hidden at any point to continue completing the task. Once you think you’ve completed the task hit the ‘Task completed’ button to answer some follow up questions.</p>
            

            <h4>Once you’re comfortable with how Loop11 functions, press ‘Task completed’ to begin Task 1.</h4>
