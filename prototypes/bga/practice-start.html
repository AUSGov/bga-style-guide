            <h2>This is a practice task to help you get familiar with our Loop11 research software.</h2>

            <p>Here’s how it works:</p> 
            
            <ol>
            <li>You will see this activity window, which contains a task for you to complete. After reading the task, press the ‘Start task’ button to begin. The activity window will then minimise and move to the bottom left corner of your screen as a purple circle.</li>

           
            <li>To check back on the activity window at any time, click on the purple circle in the bottom left corner of your screen. This will bring the activity window back up so you can read the task again or confirm what you need to do.</li>

            <li>When you believe you’ve finished the task, press the ‘Task completed’ button to answer some follow-up questions.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>Now, press the ‘Start task’ button to see how this works. Once you’re ready and comfortable with Loop11, press ‘Task completed’ to move onto Task 1.</p>
