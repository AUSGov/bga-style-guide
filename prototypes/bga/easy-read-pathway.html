                <h2>ABNs explained</h2>
                <p>An ABN is a unique 11 digit number that identifies your business to the government and community. You can use an ABN to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>identify your business to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
                <li>avoid pay as you go (PAYG) tax on payments you get</li>
                <li>claim goods and services tax (GST) credits</li>
                <li>claim energy grants credits</li>
                <li>get an Australian domain name</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Registering for an ABN through the Australian Government’s Business Registration Service is free.</p>
                <h2>Find out if you need an ABN</h2>
