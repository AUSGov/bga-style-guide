            <p>Unless you run a home-based business, you’ll likely need to buy or lease business premises.</p>
            <p>Each business has different requirements. It's important to consider your business needs and priorities
                when deciding on the type and location for your business.</p>

            <h2>Type of business premises</h2>

            <p>The type of premises you may need will depend on your business type. For example, if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sell products, you may require a retail store</li>
                <li>provide a professional service, you may only need a shared office with access to a meeting room for
                    client meetings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Types of business premises include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>warehouses, manufacturing plants or storage facilities</li>
                <li>retail premises</li>
                <li>home offices for home-based businesses</li>
                <li>shared commercial offices, hubs or co-working spaces</li>
                <li>temporary premises, such as market stalls or pop-up businesses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When choosing business premises, make sure you also consider the future needs of your business.</p>

            <h2>Buying or leasing</h2>

            <p>Once you've decided what type of premise you want, you'll need to decide if you want to buy or lease the
                space.</p>
            <p>Buying or leasing commercial property is different to engaging in residential agreements.</p>
            <p>Accountants, solicitors and business advisers can advise whether you should buy or lease your business
                premises and your business equipment. An accountant can advise you on tax implications for each option.
            </p>
            <p>If you’re considering signing a lease, make sure you understand and agree with the clauses in the lease.
            </p>
            <p>It's important to seek financial and legal advice before signing any contract. This will help you avoid
                expensive mistakes that could cost you and your business.</p>

            <h2>Choose a location</h2>

            <p>The location of your business can determine its success. When you choose a location, consider if it’s the
                right environment for your business.</p>
            <p>You may pick a location because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your suppliers or distributors are nearby</li>
                <li>the area is known for the products or services you provide</li>
                <li>businesses in the area complement yours</li>
                <li>the cost of buying or leasing is affordable</li>
                <li>the area is a growing business hub with many future opportunities</li>
            </ul>

            {% include component-examples/call-to-action-example.html
            title="Tips to choosing a location"
            text="<ul>
                <li><strong>Research different locations –</strong> gather demographic information on the area you’re
                    interested in including population, age and income to see if it’s the right market to sell your
                    product or service in.</li>
                <li><strong>Find out about other businesses in the area</strong> – other local businesses might
                    complement your business's product or service.</li>
                <li><strong>Research your competitors</strong> – find out your competitors locations and the type of
                    premises they use to sell products and services.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact local councils</strong> – find out about the area, any future or planned
                    development, zoning, rates and business activity in the region.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider the current and future needs of your business</strong> – make sure your marketing
                    plan is current and your chosen location is in line with your business goals and objectives.</li>
            </ul>"

            <h2>Changing your premises</h2>

            <p>As your business grows you may need to consider moving your business.
            <p>Reasons to move your business may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customer convenience </strong>– it’s important your location is relevant to your <a
                        href="">target market</a>. Do some research to help you understand your customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower business costs </strong>– you may be able to cut costs by moving your business to a
                    cheaper location. You may also find a different location will help you increase your profits.</li>
                <li><strong>More space </strong>– is your business bursting at the seams? Maybe you no longer have
                    enough parking space for your customers? If your business grows, consider relocating your business
                    to a bigger location.</li>
            </ul>
