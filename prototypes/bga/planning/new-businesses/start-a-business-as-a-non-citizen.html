                <p>When you start a business as a non-citizen you need to make sure you know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>what visa you need to get</li>
                    <li>how to get the right visa</li>
                    <li>what legal and government requirements apply to Australian businesses.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>1. Understand the visa process</h2>
                <p>The Department of Home Affairs is responsible for Australian business visas. If you are not an
                    Australian citizen or permanent resident, you'll need a visa to work in Australia.</p>
                <p>Before you can apply for these visas, you must be nominated by a state or territory government.</p>
                <p>Generally, you’ll need to follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Submit an expression of interest through the Department of Home Affairs’ SkillSelect online
                        service.</li>
                    <li>See if a state or territory government or the CEO of Austrade decides to invite you to apply for
                        a visa. You can wait for a state or territory government to contact you, or you can contact them
                        directly.</li>
                    <li>If you receive an invitation, you can then apply for a visa. You’ll need to meet certain
                        requirements and provide documents to support your application.</li>
                </ol>
