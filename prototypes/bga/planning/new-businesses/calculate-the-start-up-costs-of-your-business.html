            <h2>Why you should calculate start-up costs</h2>

            <p>Your start-up costs are expenses before your business generates an income. There are many costs that come
                with setting up a business and different businesses have different setup costs. Understanding start-up
                costs can help you to plan ahead, seek finance and increase your chances of business success.</p>

            <p>Follow these steps to calculate your start-up costs.</p>

            <h2>1. Research expenses</h2>

            <p>Before you start your business, you should conduct market research on your potential industry. This will
                help you to make sure that your product or service will be profitable. You'll need to gather information
                on your market, potential customers and cost of production.</p>
            <p>Your research will help you identify and plan for some of the costs to start your business, such as staff
                or marketing costs.</p>

            <h2>2. Understand your start-up costs</h2>

            <p>Your start-up costs will depend on the type of business you're starting, your business structure and the
                industry you're entering. Our template lists some expenses common to all business types, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>supplies and equipment</li>
                <li>utility connections</li>
                <li>insurance</li>
                <li><a href="">business name registration</a></li>
                <li>solicitor fees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Start-up costs are your one-off costs associated with setting up a business.</p>
            <h3>Determine your running costs</h3>
            <p>It's a good idea to make sure you'll be able to cover 6 months’ worth of running costs up front when you
                start a business.</p>
            <p>Running costs are the day-to-day expenses associated with operating your business. It's the amount of
                money you will regularly spend on things such as wages, rent and buying stock.</p>

            <h2>3. Calculate your start-up costs</h2>

            <p>Once you have your list of expenses, enter the costs into the spreadsheet. It'll calculate your total
                costs for you.</p>
            <p>If you’re using estimated costs, label them clearly and state whether your figures include or exclude
                goods and services tax (GST).</p>
