                <p>There are many ways you can find and get help for your business. Our suggestions below are simply to
                    get you started.</p>
                <h2>Talk with us directly</h2>
                <p>We understand operating a business can be complex and it can be overwhelming trying to find the right
                    information.<br /><br />Our support team can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>provide information and support to businesses affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
                    <li>help you find information about government grants, programs and services</li>
                    <li>provide information to help you start, run or grow your business</li>
                    <li>assist you to use the online Business Registration Service</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We’re available from 8am - 8pm, Monday to Friday, across Australia.</p>

                <h2>Network with your peers through events and workshops</h2>
                <p>Attend networking events and workshops to help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>stay up-to-date on industry and local information</li>
                    <li>promote your business</li>
                    <li>learn key skills from other businesses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The business workshops and seminars cover topics such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>planning for your business</li>
                    <li>record keeping and budgeting</li>
                    <li>understanding design and your intellectual property (IP)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Find grants and financial help</h2>
                <p>While the government generally doesn’t offer funding to start a business, there may be other forms of
                    assistance available to help you.</p>
                <p>Try searching for activities that suit your business, such as research and development, trade,
                    innovation or employment.</p>
                <h2>Outsource tasks</h2>
                <p>Outsourcing some tasks may be more efficient than trying to do everything yourself. Tasks that are
                    time-consuming or require specific skills may be better in the hands of a contractor or business
                    that specialises in that field. For example, many businesses outsource for their website design,
                    bookkeeping or information technology needs.</p>
                <h2>Talk to a business adviser</h2>
                <p>You don’t have to do it alone — working with an experienced business adviser or expert can help solve
                    business problems, connect you to funding and grow your industry networks.</p>
                <p>Chat to a business adviser or expert online, over the phone or face-to-face — some mobile advisers
                    can even visit your business.</p>
