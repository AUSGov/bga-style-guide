                <p>When you start a business, you need to understand what laws apply to your new business. Consult a
                    legal expert or <a href="">business adviser</a> to understand which laws you will need to follow.
                </p>

                <h2>Business registrations</h2>

                <p>If you conduct a business, you may need to comply with tax obligations. These could require you to
                    register for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Australian business number (ABN)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">goods and Services Tax (GST)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">tax file number (TFN)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">pay as you go (PAYG) withholding</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other registrations that are optional include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Business name</a> – if you want to trade under a particular name, you may need to
                        register it.</li>
                    <li><a href="">Trade marks</a> - if you want exclusive rights to a business name, you need to
                        register a trade mark.</li>
                    <li><a href="">Website domains</a> - if you set up a website, you need to register a domain name.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Fair trading</h2>

                <p>Fair trading laws ensure your business operates fairly and competitively. These laws also ensure that
                    you inform and protect your customers.</p>
                <p>To make sure your business meets fair trading regulations, you need to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Fair trading laws</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Australian Consumer Law and your business</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Competition and Consumer Act</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Australian standards</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Codes of Conduct</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you sell products or services, you need to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Australia's trade measurement laws</a></li>

                    <li><a href="">warranties and refunds</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Contracts</h2>

                <p>When you agree to do a job in exchange for money or some other benefit, you're probably entering a
                    commercial contract. This contract is legally enforceable regardless of whether it is a ‘handshake
                    deal’ or written agreement.</p>
                <p>Make sure you understand the <a href="">contract</a> before signing.</p>

                <h2>Privacy laws</h2>

                <p>If you collect and store your customers’ personal information, you must comply with <a
                        href="">privacy laws</a>. These laws detail how a business must handle personal information,
                    especially as it relates to direct marketing purposes.</p>
                <p>Use the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner <a href="">checklist</a> to help you
                    determine whether you need to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

                <h2>Employment laws</h2>
                <p>You have legal obligations when you employ people. Your obligations require you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a>pay your employees</a> correct wages</li>
                    <li>abide by <a>work health and safety</a> (WHS) regulations and codes of practice</li>
                    <li>ensure you have <a>workers’ compensation insurance</a> for each employee</li>
                    <li>not act in a way that may seriously damage an employee's reputation or cause <a>mental
                            distress</a> or humiliation</li>
                    <li>comply with any working with vulnerable people or children requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Anti-bullying laws</h2>
                <p>Bullying at work occurs when a person or group of people, repeatedly behave unreasonably towards a
                    worker and put the worker's health or safety at risk.</p>
                <p><a>Harassment and bullying</a> in the workplace has legal risks. If you employ people, be aware of
                    the steps you can take to minimise your potential liability.</p>
                <h2>Unfair dismissal</h2>
                <p>The <a>Small Business Fair Dismissal Code</a> provides small businesses with a process to follow if
                    they need to <a>dismiss an employee</a>. The Code applies to your business if you have less than 15
                    employees.</p>
                <h2>Contractors</h2>
                <p>You need to comply with different legal obligations when hiring a contractor or an employee. Make
                    sure you understand the difference between a contractor and an employee.</p>
