            <p>You’ve got an entrepreneurial spirit, but you’re a little younger than the typical business owner. Don’t
                let that stop you from starting your own business!</p>
            <h2>1. Determine your business structure</h2>
            <p>The first thing you need to decide is what kind of structure your business will use.</p>
            <p>The most common business structures are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sole trader: the simplest business to set up because it has less legal and tax obligations.</li>
                <li>Partnership: involves a number of people who carry on a business together.</li>
                <li>Company: more complex because companies are governed by boards of directors. You need to be at least
                    18 years of age to be a director of a company.</li>
                <li>Trust: a trustee carries out the business on behalf of the trust’s members.</li>
            </ul>

            link1="Find out more about the different types of business structures."

            %}

            <h2>2. Get a tax file number</h2>
            <p>You’ll need a tax file number (TFN) to do business. You can apply for a TFN at any age, but if you are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>12 years old or younger, your parent or guardian must sign on your behalf</li>
                <li>between 13 and 15 years old, either you or your parent/guardian can sign the form</li>
                <li>16 years old or older, you must sign the form yourself</li>
            </ul>

            {% include component-examples/inline-pathway-example.html
            link1="Learn how to register for a tax file number"
            page1="Register for a tax file number"
            icon1="'../../../../assets/icon-arrow-right-blue.svg' | relative_url "
            %}


            <h2>3. Get an ABN</h2>
            <p>An ABN is the number you use when you conduct business with other businesses and government.</p>
            <p>You can use an ABN to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>identify your business to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
                <li>get an Australian domain name</li>
                <li>avoid pay as you go (PAYG) tax on payments you get</li>
                <li>claim goods and services (GST) credits</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Find out if you need an ABN</h3>
            <p>Not everyone needs an ABN.</p>
            <p>The Australian Business Register has an ABN entitlement tool to help you find out if your business
                activities make you eligible for an ABN.</p>
            <h2>4. Work out what licences and registrations you need</h2>
            <p>When you start a business, it’s your responsibility to ensure that your business operates legally. This
                means you need to ensure you have the right licences and registrations.</p>
            <p>The types of licences you need depend on your industry, location and business type.</p>

            {% include component-examples/call-to-action-example.html
            title="Find the licences and permits you need for your businessme"
            text="<p>Search the Australian Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS) to find information on the
                licences you may need.</p>"
            button="Search now"
            %}


            <h2>5. Keep your finances in order</h2>
            <p>In business, it’s important to have good financial skills so you can keep track of your income and money
                you spend.</p>
            <h2>6. Work within your limits</h2>
            <p>When you start your own business you’re considered self-employed as a minor. However, even self-employed
                minors have <a>restrictions on what hours they can work</a>.</p>
            <p>The laws vary in each state and territory, but the main requirements are that you can’t work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>during school hours</li>
                <li>after 10pm on a school night</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some states and territories you may require adult supervision while you work, if you’re under a
                certain age.</p>
            <h2>7. Find support</h2>
            <p>You don't have to do it alone. Find government <a>help for your business</a>, such as business advisers,
                events and training and grants and funding to set you up for success.</p>
            <p>Our <a>Guide to starting a business guide</a> will take you through the steps involved in starting a
                business to help you understand what's ahead.</p>
            <h2>8. Employ others</h2>
            <p>After your business is up and running, you might want to <a>employ people</a> to help keep your business
                going.</p>
            <p>If you employ people older than you, your staff members may need to complete a permit or check to be
                eligible to work with a minor. The requirements for these types of checks vary in each state and
                territory, so check with your relevant government.</p>
