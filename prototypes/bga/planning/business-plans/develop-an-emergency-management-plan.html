                <h2>Why you need an emergency management plan</h2>

                <p>In Australia, natural disasters such as floods, fire and even earthquakes can strike without warning.
                    During an emergency, your main aim is to ensure your business continues operating. By carefully
                    researching and planning before an emergency happens, you’ll be ready to act quickly and
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>Our emergency management plan template includes 3 plans to help you before, during and after an
                    emergency:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The continuity plan</strong> – helps you prepare your business for an emergency by
                        identifying risks to critical areas and how to best protect them.</li>
                    <li><strong>The emergency action plan</strong> – helps you and your staff know what to do during an
                        emergency situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>The recovery plan</strong> – guides your business’s recovery after an emergency.</li>
                </ul>

                content1="<p>To prepare your business for an emergency, identify critical areas of your business and ways to protect them. Consider the following important areas of your business.</p>
                <p>List your most important or most profitable products or services. Describe current arrangements to provide each one and what you’d do if these arrangements failed – your back up options for an emergency.</p>
                <h4>Key customers</h4>
                <p>List important customers and how you’d contact them in an emergency to tell them what has happened.</p>
                <h4>Insurance</h4>
                <p>Record the insurance policies you currently hold to cover your business risks.</p>
                <p>Visit <strong>Insurance</strong>for more information.</p>
                <h4>Property and infrastructure</h4>
                <p>Record how you make your property infrastructure less vulnerable to damage. Is your property secured  with alarms, security personnel or video surveillance from unlawful entry? Do you have fire  retardant or flood resistant building materials? Are leaf litter, grass and gutters maintained regularly to minimise fire risk?</p>
                <h4>Business continuity strategies</h4>
                <p>Identify temporary office accommodation you could quickly access in an emergency situation. Record  other strategies you’ll consider to help maintain business as usual. For example, a virtual office service, an e-commerce website or e-marketplace. Visit <strong>Buying and selling online</strong> for more information.</p>
                <h4>Staff training</h4>
                <p>List your staff, their relevant skills and strengths, and any cross-training requirements that would help you to continue business in an emergency.</p>
                <h4>Information backup</h4>

                    safety equipment clearly marked.</p>

                <h4>Emergency kit</h4>
                <p>Record where your emergency kit is located or stored. Make sure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>your staff know where it is</li>
                    <li>it's clearly visible and labelled.</li>

                <p>List the contents of your emergency kit and the date each item was last checked.</p>
                <h4>Emergency team roles and responsibilities</h4>
                <p>Communication is essential when making emergency planning procedures. Consider allocating a
                    person/people to be responsible for any emergency situation. Set clear roles and responsibilities
                    and provide appropriate training.</p>"

                <h4>Business impact assessment</h4>
                <p>Assess the damage to your business. List the main damage, its impact on your business, and what

                    your market that have changed.</p>
                <h4>Marketing strategy</h4>
                <p>Detail your marketing strategy after the emergency. If your business is reopening, how will you get
                    the message out? What channels will you use to target customers? Make sure you consider any changes
                    in the market.</p>
                <p>For example, you might consider a targeted marketing effort (such as a social media campaign) to let
                    people know your business is reopening.</p>"
