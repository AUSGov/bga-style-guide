                <h2>Why you need a succession plan</h2>

                <p>When you decide to leave your business, your succession planning will help you successfully transfer
                    your business to your successor.</p>
                <p>Developing a good succession plan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ensures you are prepared for change</li>
                    <li>can make the transition out of your business easier</li>
                    <li>helps your successor prepare for their present and future work responsibilities.</li>
                </ul>

                    information if you need it.</p>
                <p>You may want to check our tips below before you start.</p>
                <h3>1. Choose a successor</h3>
                <p>You need to identify who you would like to take over your business. Your successor could be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a family member</li>
                    <li>an employee</li>
                    <li>a business partner</li>
                    <li>an outside buyer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Make sure you consider what's best for your business. Ensure your successor has the right skills and
                    that they want to take over your business.</p>
                <h3>2. Value your business</h3>
                <p>You should value your business early and often. Your business's value will help you understand how
                    much your business is currently worth.</p>
                <p>The valuation of your business may change substantially before you plan to leave, but a good
                    valuation will assist with your succession planning.</p>
                <h3>3. Keep it current</h3>
                <p>Review your plan regularly. As time passes your circumstances may change and an up-to-date succession
                    plan will ensure you're always ready in the event you need to leave earlier than anticipated.</p>
                <h3>4. Final handover</h3>
                <p>If you have made the proper preparations, when the time comes to leave you should simply be able to
                    hand over your business and step aside. By having a clear and current succession plan, you can
                    enable a smooth transition with less chance of disruption to the business's operations.</p>
