                <h2>Why you need a SWOT analysis</h2>

                <p>A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
                    and threats of your business.</p>
                <p>Developing a SWOT analysis can help you look at your business in a new way and from different
                    directions. It can also help you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>create or fine tune your business strategy</li>
                    <li>prioritise areas for business growth to achieve your business goals.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Complete your SWOT analysis</h2>

                <p>You can start the process by gathering a group of employees or advisors who have different
                    perspectives on your business. If you don’t have employees, you can ask family members, business
                    advisors or mentors. The key is to have different points of view.</p>
                <p>Using the prompting questions below as a guide, you can conduct a brainstorming session to discuss
                    ideas about each SWOT category. After brainstorming, create a final prioritised list of points in
                    our SWOT analysis template. List the factors in each category from highest to lowest priority.</p>

                    <li>What do we do well?</li>

                    on to be competitive. Ask yourself:</p>

                    <li>What and where can we improve?</li>
                    <li>What do our competitors do better?</li>

                <h2>Use your SWOT analysis</h2>

                <p>Once you have completed your SWOT analysis, it can be used to develop strategies for achieving your
                    business goals. You can create a plan to continue building on your strengths while improving on your
                    weaknesses. When using your SWOT analysis to create a strategy, ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can we use our strengths to take advantage of our opportunities?</li>
                    <li>How can we use our strengths to minimise our threats?</li>
                    <li>What do we need to do to overcome and minimise our identified weaknesses?</li>
                </ul>
