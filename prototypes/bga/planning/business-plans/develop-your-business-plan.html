                <h2>Why you need a business plan</h2>

                <p>Whether you've just started out or have been running your business for years, business planning can
                    be the key to your success. Having a business plan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>helps you to prioritise</strong> – it gives your business direction, defines your
                        objectives, maps out how you'll achieve your goals and helps you to manage possible bumps in the
                        road</li>
                    <li><strong>gives you control over your business</strong> – the planning process helps you learn
                        about the different things that could affect your success. If you're already in business, it
                        helps you to step back and look at what's working and what you can improve on</li>
                    <li><strong>helps you seek finance</strong> – if you're seeking finance for your business, you'll
                        need to show banks and investors why they should invest in your business.</li>
                </ul>

                    information if you need it.</p>
                <p>If you're developing a detailed business plan, you may want to check our tips below before you start.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Determine what your plan is for</h3>
                <p>Does your business plan have more than one purpose? Will you use it internally, or will you share it
                    externally, for example with potential investors or banks?</p>
                <p>Deciding what the purpose is, can help you develop your plan for the right audience. If the plan has
                    been developed for third parties, you will need to determine what they’ll be most interested in.</p>
                <h3>2. Prepare your finances</h3>
                <p>If you're looking for finance, lenders and investors will want to know if your finances are in order
                    and your business is in a strong financial position. They'll want to know how much money you
                    currently have, how much money you need and how much you expect to make in the near future. While a
                    bit of extra funding will help you ensure you’re covered for unexpected costs, be realistic and
                    avoid asking for more than you need.</p>
                <p>If you're starting out and don't have financial information yet, our business plan template provides
                    resources to help you get your finances ready.</p>
                <h3>3. Write your summary last</h3>
                <p>Summarise the main points of your business plan using as few words as possible. You want to get to
                    the point but not overlook important facts. This is your opportunity to sell yourself, but don't
                    overdo it. The summary should include details about your business, market, goals and what makes you
                    different from other businesses.</p>
                <h3>4. Get help</h3>
                <p>Don't leave your business plan to the last minute. It takes time, research and careful preparation to
                    develop an effective business plan.</p>
                <p>If you aren't confident in completing the plan yourself, consider getting a professional to look over
                    it and provide advice.</p>
                <p>There are a number of government services available to help you plan, start or grow your business.
                    These services can provide general advice, workshops, seminars and networking events, and can even
                    match you with a mentor or business coach.</p>
    
                <h3>5. Review your plan regularly</h3>
                <p>As your business changes, your plan will need to change to ensure your business is still heading in
                    the right direction. Having your plan up-to-date can keep you focused on where you are heading.</p>
                <p>It's a good idea to keep a record of each version of your business plan.</p>
                <h3>6. Protect your plan</h3>
                <p>Having an understanding with third parties when distributing a plan could be enough protection for
                    some businesses. But if you have innovative business practices, products or services, you may want
                    people to sign a confidentiality agreement to protect your innovations.</p>
                <p>It may also be a good idea to include some words in your plan asking the reader not to disclose the
                    details of your plan.</p>
