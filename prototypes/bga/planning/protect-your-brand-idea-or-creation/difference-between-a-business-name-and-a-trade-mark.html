<p>When you're starting out, it's important to understand what you need to register for and how to protect your business brand.</p>
<p>If you haven't registered your business name already, you probably have a good idea of what you want. So which registration do you apply for, a business name, a trade mark or both?</p>

<h2>Business names</h2>

<p>A business name is the name you trade under. It identifies who you are to your customers and other businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start operating, you must register a business name if you are trading under a name that is not your own.</li>
<li>You cannot register a business name that is identical or too similar to the registered name of another Australian business or company.</li>
<li>Registering a business name does not stop someone who has registered the name as a trade mark from using it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trade marks</h2>

<p>A trade mark is your registered brand and is used to distinguish your business from other products and services.</p>
<ul>
<li>A trade mark can be a letter, number, word, phrase, logo, image, sound, movement, shape or scent.</li>
<li>Registering a trade mark gives you exclusive rights to your business name in Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find a trade mark similar to yours which already exists, it may be possible for both trade marks to coexist if the goods and services they relate to are different.</p>
<p>For example, 'DOVE' on soap and 'DOVE' on chocolate. Although both trade marks are for the same word, 'soap' and 'chocolate' are considered to be different goods, with a different purpose and sold through different trade channels.</p>

    <h2>Protect your business</h2>

<p>If you want exclusive rights to your business name, you'll need to protect it with a trade mark. This will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>protect your name and stop others from trading with it</li>
<li>get exclusive use of that trade mark throughout Australia</li>
<li>have protection in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years.</li>
</ul>
