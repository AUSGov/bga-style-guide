<p>A design right protects the overall visual appearance of new and distinctive products. The overall visual appearance can be a combination of visual features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>shape</li>
<li>colour</li>
<li>configuration</li>
<li>pattern</li>
<li>ornamentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A design right may allow you to prevent others from using the design without your permission. You have exclusive rights to use, licence and sell the design.</p>

<h2>How long does protection last?</h2>

<p>You can have a design right registered for a maximum of 10 years. A design right initially lasts for 5 years from the date you apply and you can renew your design right so that it lasts for a further 5 years.</p>

<h2>How to get a design right</h2>

<p>There is a 2 step process to secure a design right protection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Certification</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to complete both steps to legally enforce your design right. For your best chance of protecting your design, itâ€™s important to not go public with your design until you have applied for design right protection.</p>
