                <p>A market stall is a temporary structure that you set up to sell your products or services. You can
                    sell any type of product or service from handmade jewellery to fresh produce or clothing.</p>
                <p>Market stalls are one way for you to test your product with customers or expand your business. You’ll
                    likely need some type of registration, licence, permit or insurance to run your stall. These are
                    important to protect you and the investments you've made in your business.</p>
                <h2>Licences and permits</h2>
                <div>The type of licence or permit you need will depend on the industry in which you are operating.
                    Examples of licences and permits include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Temporary food stall licence</li>
                        <li>Footpath usage permit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can find all the licences and permits you need for your business on the <a>Australian
                            Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS)</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Insurance</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Many market organisers require you to insure your stall in case things go wrong. You may need
                            both public liability and product liability insurance to make sure you're covered. You might
                            also consider professional indemnity insurance to help cover the cost of any legal action.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some insurance providers will sell insurance packages specifically for market stall holders.
                            These are sometimes called 'Market Trading Insurance'.</p>
                        <p>Established markets may offer insurance as part of the registration fee. If this applies to
                            the market you want to sell at, make sure you understand what that insurance covers you for.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you feel more comfortable, take out your own insurance in addition to the insurance on
                            offer from the market. Make sure that your insurance package includes your set up and pack
                            down time.</p>

                <h2>Regulations and requirements</h2>
                <h3>Labels and measurements</h3>
                <p>If you sell goods by measurement (e.g. weight, length or volume), you need to comply with trade
                    measurement laws. Trade measurement laws cover how you measure and label your goods and the
                    measurement tools, such as scales, that you use. Your legal requirements may differ depending on the
                    type of product and quantity you sell.</p>
                <p>Check the trade measurement laws to make sure you comply with the measurement requirements for your
                    market stall product.</p>
                <h3>Product safety</h3>
                <p>You’re legally required to sell goods that are safe to use and free from defects that may cause
                    injury. Our product safety rules and standards page provides information on product safety
                    requirements and product laws in your state or territory.</p>
                <h3>Food market stalls</h3>
                <p>There are more legal requirements for market stall owners selling food or products for consumption.
                </p>
                <h3>Food safety standards</h3>
                <p>The food you sell at a market must comply with the Food Standards Code (the Code).</p>
                <p>Food safety standards make sure that the food supplied is safe and suitable for people to eat.</p>


                {% include component-examples/call-to-action-example.html
                text="<h4>To make sure you meet your obligations, familiarise yourself with the Code, in particular Food Safety Practices and General Requirements Standard 3.2.2.</h4><p>Obligations can include how you manage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>temperature control</li>
                    <li>cleanliness</li>
                    <li>hand washing</li>
                    <li>labelling</li>
                </ul>"

                %}


                <p>Some temporary food businesses may be able to apply for exemptions to some of these standards. Check
                    with your local council to find out if you're exempt from any of the requirements.</p>
                <p>We recommend that you contact the market organiser in advance, and find out what facilities and
                    practices they have in place for food safety, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>where to find the closest bathroom</li>
                    <li>what kind of access you'll have to water at your stall</li>
                    <li>how to dispose of food scraps and food waste</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some local councils conduct inspections at market stalls to check that good food safety practices are
                    being followed. Be prepared and make sure your stall complies.</p>
                <h3>State and territory food safety regulations</h3>
                <p>Food safety regulations can vary between states, territories and local councils. Become familiar with
                    your local obligations so you’re certain that you comply:</p>
