                <h2>1. Review your market research</h2>

                <p>When you start to develop your innovation strategy it’s a good idea to review your market research to help you identify:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> key gaps in the market which are opportunities for you to be innovative</li>
                <li> how other organisations are being innovative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may also like to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> ask your customers for feedback to gain insights to improve your processes, products or services</li>
                <li> ask your employees for ideas based on their experience with customers.</li>
                </ul>

<h2>2. Understand your opportunities</h2>

<p>Opportunities for innovation occur in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>internal business</strong> opportunities through changes to processes</li>
<li> <strong>external business</strong> opportunities through collaborations and product or service offerings.</li>
</ul>

{% include component-examples/call-to-action-example.html
    text="<h3>Identify innovation opportunities for your business</h3>
    <p>Consider the ideas below and make notes on how each one could support your business:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href=''''>export or import</a> products or services</li>
    <li>invent a <a href=''>new product or service</a></li>
    <li>streamline your operations to reduce cost</li>
    <li>seek out <a href=''>tenders and contracts</a></li>
    <li><a href=''>collaborate with others</a></li>
    <li>expand your <a href=''>business online</a></li>
    <li><a href=''>social media</a> to extend your customer reach.</li>
    </ul>"

    %}

    <h2>3. Decide on open or closed innovation</h2>
<p>Once you understand your opportunities for innovation, you must decide if you will use an open or closed innovation model.</p>
<p>Open innovation means that you:</p>
<ul>
<li> actively seek collaboration with external partners</li>
<li> recognise that no business has all the expertise nor owns all the best ideas</li>
<li> understand that solutions may already exist in other industries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closed innovation allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li> control all intellectual property and profit within your organisation</li>
<li> maintain strong boundaries of a project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Find support and guidance</h2>

<p>Connect with a business adviser or find a grant or program to help drive innovation in your business.</p>

<h2>5. Update your business plan</h2>

<p>An innovation strategy is just one part of your business plan. Make sure you update your business plan to reflect your innovative ideas and processes.</p>
