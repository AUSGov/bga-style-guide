        <p>The lightweight checklist pattern consists of a list of numbered items. The items open to reveal content allowing users to progress through the list in a measured way. Unlike the standard checklist pattern the lightweight checklist does not have checkboxes and users do not tick off items as they progress though them.</p>

        <h2 class="section-start" id="guidelines-for-use">Guidelines for use</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The checklist pattern presents the user with an end to end journey in logical steps and provides links to content to help them complete each step.</p>
        <p>The main difference between the lightweight and standard checklist patterns is the amount of content each contains. The lightweight pattern should be used for simpler journeys or a series of tips. It does not allow for nested items within each main item.</p>
        <h3>General rules:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Should only be used where there is a logical order to complete a journey.</li>
        <li>Provides numbered steps that presents a specific start and end point.</li>
        <li>Can include online and offline actions.</li>
        <li>When you are educating the user about a specific stage in an end to end journey (use the tutorial pattern).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When not to use this pattern:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>When the user only needs to read guidance and not take an action (use Guide pattern instead).</li>
        </ul>
