        <h2 class="section-start" id="guidelines-for-use">Guidelines for use</h2>

        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Used in ALBIS to display a collection of results at the end of a tool process. The two different result tiles are used in different tool contexts:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>ABLIS result tile accordions are used in the ABLIS guided search results page. In the ABLIS guided search users can be presented with large number of result items to consider. The accordion tiles are used to minimize the amount of information initially displayed on the page.</li>
            <li>ABLIS search tiles are used in the ABLIS keyword search. The keyword search uses pagination to minimize the amount of content on the screen.</li>
         </ul>
