        <p>Used to attract the users attention to important information during a process.</p>
        <p>The modal dialog appears on top of the main content which is disabled until the modal is closed.</p>
        <h3>When to use this component:</h3>
        <p>Modal dialogs can disrupt to the user experience and should not be used often. Only use them to aid the user
            in completing a workflow or process.</p>
        <p>Use modals to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display important warnings or correct critical errors.</li>
            <li>Allow the user to enter information for continuing a current process.</li>
            <li>Break up a complex workflow into simpler steps.</li>
        </ul>
