                            <p>This tool helps small business employers to make a basic employment contract that
                                complies with workplace
                                laws. Use it to create a contract for an employee under the national industrial
                                relations system. You
                                can use it for full-time, part-time and casual employees to whom a modern award applies.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the tool you'll find:</p>

                                <li>optional clauses to help set expectations and protect your business.</li>
